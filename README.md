# Assignment-3

This project is the pixels loading the image. The circles will load the image slowly and overtime it will reveal the image.

Controls:
Pressing 1 will change the pixels to red, pressing 2 will change the pixels to blue, pressing 3 will change the pixels to green. The buttons can happen simultaneously and both can be pressed to produce color (ie. pressing 1 and then 2 will make the pixels yellow). Pressing 4 will reset the colors to it's original state. Pressing r will reset the program to load in the pixels again.
